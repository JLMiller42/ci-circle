Our workflow is looking pretty good! We have now set up some automated tests to validate any new changes by creating a build and running automated unit tests against that build, but we can go one step futher and add continuous deployment to our workflow.

### What is Continuous deployment

Continuous deployment, also known as CD, is an extended step that builds from the succession of criteria's defined in the continuous integration. In an CD implementation, when all continuous integration criteria's are executed without any failure, there are automation at various stages which will deploy the new set of changes to the production environment.

The goal of CD is to mainly reduce lead time. This is achieved through shorter feedback loop since product owners and or developers are able to collect feedback to determine how an implemented new feature is used by users.

There are several ways to deploy your code changes, but for our case, we'll be using GitHub pages to deploy our changes. This deployment method is nice since GitHub pages is built into all Git repositories on GitHub.

## Step 12: Deploy

Deploying with GitHub pages will result in automatic deployments anytime changes are merged into master.

### :keyboard: Activity: Enable GitHub pages to deploy
