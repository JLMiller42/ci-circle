Our workflow is looking pretty good! We have now set up some automated tests for any new changes. We can go one step further and add continuous deployment to our workflow.

### What is Continuous deployment

**Continuous deployment**, or **CD**, is an extended step that builds from the automation in CI. CD is automation at various stages, deploying new changes to the different environment.

The goal of CD is to reduce the time it takes to finish a project. Automation provides shorter feedback loops. This could look like faster testing cycles, or faster deployment and user feedback.

There are several ways to deploy your code changes. For this repository, we'll deploy with GitHub Pages. If you'd like to learn more about GitHub Pages, there are a [few learning lab courses](https://lab.github.com/courses?tag=GitHub%20Pages) you might be interested in.

## Step 12: Deploy

Whenever there is a new commit on `master`, GitHub pages will deploy.
