# Welcome

In this repository, we'll be diving into the world of Continuous Integration. **Continuous Integration**, or **CI**, can benefit your projects and change how you work on GitHub. If you're new to Continuous Integration, you may be thinking, "What exactly is it, and do I need it in my project?"

## What is CI? Why should you care?

[CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) can help you stick to your team’s quality standards by running tests and reporting the results on GitHub. CI tools run builds and tests, triggered by commits. The results post back to GitHub in the pull request. This reduces context switching for developers, and improves consistency for testing. The goal is fewer bugs in production and faster feedback while developing.

There are several CI tools that integrate with GitHub. You can find some examples in the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/category/continuous-integration).  With so many options, you can pick the best tool for the job.

The following diagram shows the relative percentage of the top 10 CI tools used with GitHub.com.

Our analysis also shows that many repositories use more than one CI tool. This allows teams to use tools for what each tool does best, instead of being stuck in a box with only one tool.

The tools that will work best for you depends on many factors, including:

- Programming language and application architecture
- Operating system and browsers you plan to support
- Your team’s experience and skills
- Scaling capabilities and plans for growth
- Geographic distribution of dependent systems and the people who use them
- Packaging and delivery goals
