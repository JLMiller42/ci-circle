Awesome, nice work getting those branch protections in place :tada:

However, just before you enabled your branch protections, a contributor committed invalid syntax on `master` therefore breaking your CI build. Fortunately, your newly created test for successful builds caught it and you turned on branch protections so these types of errors won't make it into future builds.

Explain the error:
```shell
  Liquid Exception: Liquid syntax error (line 1): Unknown tag 'site' in docs/01_getting_ready_for_class.md
```

## Step 6: Fix the broken build

Let's fix the build!

### :keyboard: Activity: Fix the build in your codebase

1. In files changed, find the file with `{% site.times %}`
1. Either remove this line or change it to: `{{ site.time }}`
