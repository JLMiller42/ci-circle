tell the learner the branch is protected, but since then someone has committed something to master.

They committed something that breaks our build! Fortunately (1) our tests caught it, (2) we turned on branch protections so these kinds of things don't make it to future builds.

Explain the error:
```shell
  Liquid Exception: Liquid syntax error (line 1): Unknown tag 'site' in docs/01_getting_ready_for_class.md
```

Fix the build by removing `site.times`.
