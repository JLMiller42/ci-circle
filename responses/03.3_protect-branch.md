Now that you've added some validation tests to your CI build, it's time to turn on some branch protections. Protected branches ensure that collaborators on your repository cannot make irrevocable changes to specific branches. This also allows you to enable CI required status checks to pass before merging or require branches to be up-to-date before merging.
