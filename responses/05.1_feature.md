We just introduced some links to the codebase, asks learner to add a unit test

Now that we're linking out, we should make sure none of these links break.

Add the following to your config file:

```
bundle exec htmlproofer ./_site --check-html
```

Your entire config file should now look like this:

```yaml
version: 2
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/ruby:2.4.1-node-browsers

    steps:
      - checkout

      - run:
          name: install dependencies
          command: bundle install

      - run:
          name: build the jekyll site
          command: bundle exec jekyll build

  testlinks:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/ruby:2.4.1-node-browsers

    steps:
      - checkout

      - run:
          name: install dependencies
          command: bundle install

      - run:
          name: build the jekyll site
          command: bundle exec jekyll build

      - run:
          name: run html proofer
          command: bundle exec htmlproofer ./_site --check-html

workflows:

  build_and_test:
    jobs:

      - testlinks
```
