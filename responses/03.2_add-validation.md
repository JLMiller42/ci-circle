In this pull request, I've added some tests to help validate any incorrect HTTP links within the project. This is just one example of how you can customize specific validations that will be ran when your CI starts a build. I've added this validation as a `script/test.rb` file, but I need you to add a **run action** to your `.circleci/config.yml` file.  

## Step 4: Add validation

Add a link checker test to your `config.yml` file.
