Nice work getting this pull request opened!

This pull request adds a `.circleci/config.yml` configuration file that will return a successful build. This configuration file is where we define how we want the code to be built and tested.

Whether your project requires standard unit tests or more custom configuration, this is the place to do it.

There isn't much in this file right now, but we're going to change that. We'll make a change to configure the build environment.

You'll notice a [Docker image](https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/userguide/storagedriver/imagesandcontainers/) that will be used to execute the build, and a `checkout` that allows Circle to checkout to your project.

Since Circle will only run a build after new commits are added, add the below text to the file in place of the `REPLACE-ME-WITH-DOCKER-IMAGE` placeholder:

```yaml
circleci/ruby:2.4.1-node-browsers
```

## Step 3: Specify the Docker image

To get the CI build to succeed, replace the placeholder text and commit the change.
