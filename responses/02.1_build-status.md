Nice work getting this pull request opened!

This pull request adds a `.circleci/config.yml` configuration file. This file is necessary to return a successful build and where we define how to build and test the code.

All projects have different needs, ranging from standard unit tests to custom configuration.  Regardless of the definition of "success" for your project, this is the place to define it.

There isn't much in this file right now, but we're going to change that. We'll make a change to configure the build environment.

Notice that this configuration file includes a Docker image to execute the build, defining the environment. There's also a `checkout` command that allows CircleCI to access your project.

CircleCI is only triggered by new commits. To trigger CircleCI, add the below text in place of the `REPLACE-ME-WITH-DOCKER-IMAGE` placeholder:

```yaml
githubtraining/ci-custom:latest
```

## Step 3: Specify the Docker image

To get the CI build to succeed, replace the placeholder text and commit the change.
