Great work enabling CI on your repository!

Now that it's enabled, let's see what happened when we ran our first build. Navigate to the [last commit on `master`]({{ repo }}). Notice that the commit now has a red ‚ùå next to it, and clicking on it will give you the following information:

Our build is failing because we currently don't have a configuration file in our project. A configuration file is necessary for our CI to generate a successful build.

Let's add a configuration file to our project so the CI can build.
