With the addition of links to our code base, we should add a unit test as one of our CircleCI jobs that run whenever it builds. 

Let's add a test using HTMLProofer to test for any broken links, images, or HTML. By adding this to our `testlinks` unit test, HTMLProofer will test our code before it gets merged.

CircleCI allows us to configure multiple jobs using a feature called [Workflows](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/workflows-overview/). Since we're interested in performing two jobs (a build, and a test for links), we'll use Workflows.

I've already added some things necessary for HTMLProofer test to run, and implemented the use of the Workflows feature. Next, replace the placeholder text with the following:

```yaml
bundle exec htmlproofer ./_site --check-html
```

## Step 9: Add an HTMLProofer unit test

Let's make sure all links are valid by adding a link checker unit test.
