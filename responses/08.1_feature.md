With the addition of links to our code base, we should add a unit test as one of our CircleCI jobs that run whenever it builds. Let's add a test using HTMLProofer to test for any broken links, images, or HTML. By adding this to our `testlinks` unit test, HTMLProofer will test our code before it gets merged.

I've already added some things necessary for HTMLProofer test to run. Next, replace the placeholder text with the following:

```yaml
bundle exec htmlproofer ./_site --check-html
```

## Step 9: Add an HTMLProofer unit test

Let's make sure all links are valid by adding a link checker unit test.
