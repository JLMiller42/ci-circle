asks learner to open a PR against `initial-circle-config`

This adds the bare bones configuration file and will return a successful build. But Circle will only run after new commits are added, so please add this to the file in place of `REPLACE-ME-WITH-DOCKER-IMAGE`:

```yaml
circleci/ruby:2.4.1-node-browsers
```

Explain what the rest of the file is doing. Explain that the checkout step doesn't do much except allow circle to checkout to our project.
