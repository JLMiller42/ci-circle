In modern software development, developers integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. With such frequent code changes, how do you ensure your code is bug-free? Continuous Integration (CI) is an approach to software development in which tests run automatically anytime code is changed, saving you time and giving your team improved reliability. Continuous Deployment or Delivery (CD) refers to whatever happens after these tests run. If they pass, your new code can be automatically deployed to production, with the help of a CI/CD platform like CircleCI.

After completing this course, you will be able to:

- define continuous deployment
- identify how projects use CI
- set up continuous integration for one of your projects
- protect branches based on the result of a build from continuous integration
- customize builds
- add tests for your project
