Once you've written code, how do you ensure it's bug free? GitHub makes use of continuous integration (CI)â€”a requirement in modern software development when developers integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Even better, adding automated tests and controls to your pipeline saves you time and gives your team improved reliability.

After completing this course, you will be able to:

- define continuous deployment
- identify how projects use CI
- set up continuous integration for one of your projects
- protect branches based on the result of a build from continuous integration
- customize builds
- add tests for your project
